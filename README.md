# TypeScript

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other features to JavaScript, making it more robust and scalable. TypeScript is widely adopted in the development of large-scale applications, as it provides better tooling, code maintainability, and type safety.

## Key Features of TypeScript

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript introduces static typing, allowing developers to define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps catch type-related errors during development and provides better code documentation.

- **Type Inference**: TypeScript infers types based on the assigned values, reducing the need for explicit type annotations. It analyzes the code and determines the most appropriate type, improving developer productivity.

- **Interfaces**: TypeScript supports the use of interfaces, which define the structure and behavior of objects. Interfaces provide a way to enforce contracts and ensure that objects adhere to specific shapes.

- **Classes and Object-Oriented Programming**: TypeScript adds class-based object-oriented programming to JavaScript. It supports features like inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction, allowing developers to organize and structure their code more effectively.

- **Module System**: TypeScript has a built-in module system that provides better code organization and separation. Modules allow developers to encapsulate related code and manage dependencies between different parts of the application.

- **Enhanced Tooling**: TypeScript integrates with modern development tools, such as code editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and build systems (e.g., Webpack). It offers features like autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring support, enhancing the overall developer experience.

## Getting Started with TypeScript

To start using TypeScript in your projects, follow these steps:

1. **Install TypeScript**: TypeScript can be installed globally using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and run the following command:
